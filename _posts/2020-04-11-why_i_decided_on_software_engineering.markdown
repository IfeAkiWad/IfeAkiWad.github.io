First it all began with a desire for more for myself. By February 2020, I had been a college graduate for over two years; I had been unemployed for over a year; I had a two month old baby, and my family had been struggling financially. Being a one income family of three in Chicago was already taking its toll on my husband and me. My husband was the only one working and providing for our household, and I very much was ready to contribute to the household. The hovering dilemma was that I didn't know where to start from. Weeks prior, I would brainstorm on paths and avenues for a secondary income.

I stumbled across Career Karma, and 21 days later my entire life changed. I was accepted to not one, but two bootcamps; I had started a squad that represents black women in tech. An opportunity in the tech industry was never an option for me. I never even fathomed any of it as an option. I know that financial freedom was a huge driving factor, however, now it's more personal. Pursuing Software engineering is a new challenge--uncharted territory. I'm ready to learn new skills and learn more about myself as I tarry on this path. I know that my confidence and self-esteem will explode towards the sky. I'm so ready to introduce myself as a software engineer!
