I don't know if it's subtle or not, but first Mile is definitely a weeding out process. Those first two weeks are probably the most challenging part of the program. Everything is so foreign at thst point! I definitely thought I was gonna have an aneurysm while trying to get through to the end.

The important thing to know is that the "weeding out" process should not be percieved as malicious way to get rid of people. It's should just be viewed as a challenge. A very necessary challenge. During this time, I had to remind myself that Software engineering is what I want to pursue. Therefore, this is what I had to endure. 

In other words, it's omportant to know that you are sure about what you are doing.
