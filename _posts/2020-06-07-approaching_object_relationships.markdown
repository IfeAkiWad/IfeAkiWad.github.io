    Object Relationships in Ruby is not a diificult concept to grasp. However, I definitely had a hard time applying it to my 

project. My project's dmemand hinted that I was going to need to build "has many object" code. My Harry Potter project 

had an endpoint th at listed individual Hogwarts houses. Each house listed members, howeveer, the members array only 

listed the IDs of the members. I wanted to match the members IDs to the character IDs that had the names and further 

information. It was a little tricky to accomplish. 

     I tried iterating through the PotterHouse class to find the member IDs to maybe shovel in the iteration of the Character 
		 
class that selected the characters' names. That approach did not seem to work. I had to re arrange the project to 

demand a different function. However, I will figure out how to approach it again.
